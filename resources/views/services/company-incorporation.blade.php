                <h2>Company Incorporation & Trade Licenses</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">Company incorporation in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a complex procedure that requires a team of professionals to handle the various steps required to accomplish the process. The first step is to decide the type of business entity to be incorporated. The most common form of business entity is a limited liability company. The next step is to select and register the trade name for the company. Following this, the company must obtain licenses from the relevant authorities and complete the necessary paperwork. Once the company is registered, the company must register with the Ministry of Labor, establish a company bank account, and register any intellectual property rights.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">Trade licenses in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are divided into two categories: industrial and commercial. Industrial licenses are required for manufacturing activities and commercial licenses are required for services and trading. The type of license required depends on the type of business and the location. The process of obtaining a trade license involves registration with the relevant authorities, providing documents such as the Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association, and obtaining approval from the Ministry of Economy. Once the license is obtained, the company must renew it annually and ensure that the license is kept up to date with the latest regulations.</p>

                                    <p class="text-justify">A professional business sole proprietorship covers a range of professions from owning a restaurant to a consultancy firm. Sole proprietorships providing services require a Local Service Agent (LSA) if they are owned by a National of a country other than the UAE or GCC countries. The local service agent is a UAE National who manages licensing requirements and other government-related matters for your business, in exchange for an annual fee. A sole proprietorship can only be owned by an individual, not a company. 100% ownership of this business, control all of its operations and 100% of any profits remains with the owner. Likewise, in case of any financial obligation or business debt the 100% onus remains on the owner to fulfill the same. A professional type sole proprietorship may be owned by an individual of any nationality for providing services that are lawfully permitted. A sole proprietorship that is industrial or commercial can be owned only by UAE Nationals or GCC Nationals.</p>

A branch office is lawfully regarded as part of its parent company and does not have a separate legal identity from that of its parent company. Thus, the name of the branch office will be the same as that of the parent company. Branch offices are required to have a UAE national as a local service agent. UAE nationals or companies 100% owned by UAE nationals may be appointed as local service agents. The local service agent manages licensing requirements and other government-related matters for your business, in exchange for an annual fee. A branch office in the UAE may only be engaged in activities service similar to those of the parent company. It is important to note that a branch office is not permitted to carry on the commercial business within the UAE. A Representative Office of a foreign company is legally distinct from the branch office. A representative office of a foreign company is only permitted to promote the sale of its products and facilitate contracts with its parent in the UAE. A Representative Office cannot conduct a sale or production by itself. In addition to the above limitations, representative offices have other restrictions in that they are not allowed to obtain credit facilities or put forward offers. As in the case of a branch office, it is necessary when establishing a representative office to appoint a local service agent.</p>
