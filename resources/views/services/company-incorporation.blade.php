                <h2>Company Incorporation & Trade Licenses</h2>
                <p class="text-justify">Company incorporation in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a complex procedure that requires a team of professionals to handle the various steps required to accomplish the process. The first step is to decide the type of business entity to be incorporated. The most common form of business entity is a limited liability company. The next step is to select and register the trade name for the company. Following this, the company must obtain licenses from the relevant authorities and complete the necessary paperwork. Once the company is registered, the company must register with the Ministry of Labor, establish a company bank account, and register any intellectual property rights.</p>

            <div class="col-12">
                <p class="text-justify">Trade licenses in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are divided into two categories: industrial and commercial. Industrial licenses are required for manufacturing activities and commercial licenses are required for services and trading. The type of license required depends on the type of business and the location. The process of obtaining a trade license involves registration with the relevant authorities, providing documents such as the Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association, and obtaining approval from the Ministry of Economy. Once the license is obtained, the company must renew it annually and ensure that the license is kept up to date with the latest regulations.</p>
